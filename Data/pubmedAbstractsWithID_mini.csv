27047480,This mini-review describes three biological systems. All three include competing molecules and a limiting molecule that binds the competing molecules. Such systems are extensively researched by economists. In fact,, the issue of limited resources is the defining feature of economic systems. Therefore,, we call these systems ,"econsystems.," In an econsystem,, the allocation of the limiting molecule between the competing molecules determines the behavior of the system. A cell is an example of an econsystem. Therefore,, a change in the allocation of a limiting molecule as a result of,, for instance,, an abnormal change in the concentration of one of the competing molecules,, may result in abnormal cellular behavior,, and disease. The first econsystem described in this mini-review includes a long non-coding RNA and a messenger RNA (lncRNA and mRNA). The limiting molecule is a microRNA (miRNA). The lncRNA and mRNA are known as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The second econsystem includes two receptors,, and the limiting molecule is a ligand. The third econsystem includes a cis-regulatory element of a latent virus and that of a human gene. The limiting molecule is a transcription complex that binds both cis-elements.
27047388,High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has been reported to be more beneficial for physical adaptation than low-to-moderate exercise intensity. Recently,, it is becoming increasingly evident that circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) may distinguish between specific stress signals imposed by variations in the duration,, modality,, and type of exercise. The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not HIIE is superior to vigorous-intensity continuous exercise (VICE),, which is contributing to develop effective fitness assessment. Twenty-six young males were enrolled,, and plasma samples were collected prior to exercise and immediately after HIIE or distance-matched VICE. The miRNA level profiles in HIIE were initially determined using TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA). And the differentially miRNAs levels were validated by stem-loop quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Furthermore,, these selective c-miRNAs were measured for VICE. Our results showed that some muscle-related miRNAs levels in the plasma,, such as miR-1,, miR-133a,, miR-133b,, and miR-206 significantly increased following HIIE or VICE compared to those at rest (P < 0.05),, and there was only a significant reduction in miR-1 level for HIIE compared to VICE (P < 0.05),, while no significant differences were observed for other muscle-related miRNAs between both exercises (P > 0.05). In addition,, some tissue-related or unknown original miRNA levels,, such as miR-485-5p,, miR-509-5p,, miR-517a,, miR-518f,, miR-520f,, miR-522,, miR-553,, and miR-888,, also significantly increased (P < 0.05) in both exercises compared to rest. However,, no significant differences were found between both exercises (P > 0.05). Overall,, endurance exercise assessed in this study both led to significant increases in selective c-miRNAs of comparable magnitude,, suggesting that both types of endurance exercise have general stress processes. Accordingly,, the similar responses to both acute exercises likely indicate both exercises can be used interchangeably. Further work is needed to reveal the functional significance and signaling mechanisms behind changes in c-miRNA turnover during exercise.
27047385,Preeclampsia is a syndrome characterized by hypertension during pregnancy,, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both mother and newborn in developing countries. Some advances have increased the understanding of pathophysiology of this disease. For example,, reduced utero-placental blood flow associated with impaired trophoblast invasion may lead to a hypoxic placenta that releases harmful materials into the maternal and feto-placental circulation and impairs endothelial function. Identification of these harmful materials is one of the hot topics in the literature,, since these provide potential biomarkers. Certainty,, such knowledge will help us to understand the miscommunication between mother and fetus. In this review we highlight how placental extracellular vesicles and their cargo,, such as small RNAs (i.e.,, microRNAs),, might be involved in endothelial dysfunction,, and then in the angiogenesis process,, during preeclampsia. Currently only a few reports have addressed the potential role of endothelial regulatory miRNA in the impaired angiogenesis in preeclampsia. One of the main limitations in this area is the variability of the analyses performed in the current literature. This includes variability in the size of the particles analyzed,, and broad variation in the exosomes considered. The quantity of microRNA targets genes suggest that practically all endothelial cell metabolic functions might be impaired. More studies are required to investigate mechanisms underlying miRNA released from placenta upon endothelial function involved in the angiogenenic process.
